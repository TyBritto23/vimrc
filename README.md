# Steps
1. run `curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim` within your terminal
2. Go into the .vimrc and type `:PlugInstall`
3. Restart vim to see changes 


- If step 1 isn't working go to [https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/blob/master/plug.vim] and paste that code into `~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim` (you will need to make the `plug.vim` file)
